## Week 2 report ##

This week I started the utility functionality of the project: reading a
file and generating a list of words.
I also started using JavaDoc and configured CheckStyle. In addition, I began on constructing unit tests in parallel with the main code and configured Jacoco to be able to follow the test coverage.
I'm a bit rusty when it comes to Java but it's all coming back to me fairly fast.

The next step is to create the trie structure that will be the 'heart' of the project, first with pre-supplied structures and then eventually with my own implementation.

Question: Are there any performance pitfalls to be wary of when creating the trie structure? Is there a recommended way to build it from basic data structures?
