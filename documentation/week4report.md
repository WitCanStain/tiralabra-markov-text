## Week 4 report ##

This week I added more testing and started work on implementing some of the existing data structure functionality with more basic structures. Namely,
this week I started replacing ArrayList with array functionality. It presents its own challenges, particularly when it comes to adding new elements and keeping track
of indices, but with some helper functions it seems to be working so far with all the ArrayList functionality in the Trie class having been replaced by array functionality. 
I am not sure whether it's better to simply replace all instances of ArrayList with an equivalent concoction of arrays or to implement my own ArrayList class, but I expect
that the answer will present itself to me if I find myself unable to proceed without doing so. Replacing HashMap is going to be more complicated so I am saving it for
last because it scares me. After that, the actual 'algorithmic' part of the program should be mostly in line with course requirements. I also started with the implementation document (it is surprisingly difficult to find simple places to draw tree diagrams online).


Time used: 4 hours.
